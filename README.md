# hello-world

Hello there!

My name is Freddy. I just created my first repository in GitHub as part of my learning journey in data science! Currently, I am enrolled in a course in Coursera titled "Data Science Specialization" by Johns Hopkins University. Excited to learn more about data science! 

That's all for now. Thanks for visiting!
